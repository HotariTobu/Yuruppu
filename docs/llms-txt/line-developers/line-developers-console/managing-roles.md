# Managing roles

By managing provider and channel roles, you can control the information that developers can view and edit on the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/). This page describes the types of roles that can be assigned to developers registered on providers and channels.

The provider and channel each have respective roles.

- [Provider roles](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-developers-console/managing-roles/#roles-for-provider)
- [Channel roles](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-developers-console/managing-roles/#roles-for-channel)

## Provider roles 

A developer who is registered as a provider can be given either the Admin role or Member role.

It's possible to grant channel access to a developer without granting provider access. In this case, the developer's role in the provider will be "No role".

| | Admin | Member | No role \*1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| View provider name | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| View provider ID | ✅ | ✅ \*2 | ✅ \*2 |
| Edit provider name | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Delete provider \*3 | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View list of channels linked to provider | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Create a channel under provider | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Add or delete developer to/from provider | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View or edit provider role settings | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

\*1 Only with access to the channel linked to the provider.

\*2 Cannot view the **Provider settings** screen, but provider ID will be included in the URL when developer selects a provider.

\*3 Cannot delete a provider with existing channels.

**On provider roles and channel roles**

Note the following points on provider roles and channel roles:

- Even with the Admin role on the provider, without channel access, you can't see detailed information of the channel that is linked to the provider
- Even if you grant provider access to a developer, the developer won't automatically be given access to the channel(s) linked to the provider
- When deleting a developer from the provider, even if **Also delete the selected developer(s) from the channels that belong to this provider.** is checked, the developer won't be deleted from the channel(s) with the status "Pending"

<!-- note end -->

<!-- tip start -->

**What is the difference between &quot;Member&quot; and &quot;No role&quot; on the provider?**

Both "Member" and "No role" on the provider can only view the provider name.

If you grant the Member role to a developer on a provider, you can add the developer to a channel linked to the provider, simply by clicking **Import from provider** on the **Roles** tab of the channel.

**Import from provider** is only available to a developer account with the Admin role both in the channel and the provider.

**Restrictions on adding a developer with an Admin role in Messaging API channels**

If developer A is registered as an Admin in 100 Messaging API channels, developer A cannot be added as an Admin to Messaging API channels created by developer B, but can be added as a Member or Tester.

This is because it conflicts with the "LINE Official Account Manager restrictions" described in [The number of channels that can be created](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-developers-console/overview/#number-of-channels).

<!-- note end -->

#### "The email address entered when sending an invitation" will be used only for the invitation 

The email address you enter when clicking **Invite by email** will be used only for an invitation to the channel. The role specified at the time of the invitation will be granted to the developer account that logs in to the LINE Developers Console after clicking **Accept the invitation** in the email.

"The email address entered when sending an invitation" doesn't have to be the same as "the email address of the developer account to which a role is granted". Therefore, note that a role may be unintentionally granted to a developer account that is registered with an email address different from the one used for the invitation.

<!-- note start -->

**Note when you receive an invitation**

When receiving an invitation and granting a role to your developer account, take note of the following:

- If you haven't logged in to the LINE Developers Console, log in to the LINE Developers Console with a developer account that should be given the role
- If you've already logged in to the LINE Developers Console, make sure that the developer account you are logging in is the one which should be given the role

<!-- note end -->
