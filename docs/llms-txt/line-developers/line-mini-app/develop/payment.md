## LINE Pay 

### Preparing LINE Pay Merchant Account 

To use LINE Pay on LINE MINI App, you need a LINE Pay Merchant Account. If you don't have one yet, apply on the [LINE Pay's official website](https://pay.line.me/portal/global/main).

### Developing a service that uses LINE Pay 

Once you acquire a LINE Pay Merchant account, integrate LINE Pay to your LINE MINI App. For more information on LINE Pay, see the [Online payment documentation](https://developers-pay.line.me/online) in LINE Pay Developers.

When using LINE Pay, the payment will be processed as follows:

1. When a user initiates a transaction on your LINE MINI App, the payment process on LINE Pay is launched.

### Testing LINE Pay 

To test your payment process implementation, you can use the [sandbox](https://developers-pay.line.me/sandbox) provided by LINE Pay.

## Other payment methods 

To offer other means of payment on your LINE MINI App, implement them as you would on ordinary web pages. However, you must design the process so that users are redirected to your LINE MINI App page after completing a transaction on an external domain or app.
