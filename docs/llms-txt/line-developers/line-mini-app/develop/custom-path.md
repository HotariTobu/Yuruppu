# Configuring Custom Path

<!-- tip start -->

**This feature can only be used for verified MINI Apps**

This feature is only available for verified MINI Apps.

<!-- tip end -->

Custom Path is a unique string that is set in the LIFF URL of published channel. The Custom Path feature allows you to set your own string in the LIFF URL as follows:

| Example URL with LIFF ID | Example of setting Custom Path |
| --- | --- |
| `https://miniapp.line.me/123456-abcdefg` | `https://miniapp.line.me/cony_coffee` |

For example, by setting a unique name as a Custom Path, users will be able to identify which brand or shop's LINE MINI App from the URL. Even when Custom Path is set, the URL by LIFF ID can still be accessed as before.

## How to apply 

If you use the Custom Path feature in your LINE MINI App, an application is required. The application differs depending on the area where the service is provided.

## Notes on applying for Custom Path 

Even if a Custom Path is set, the LIFF URL with the Custom Path set won't be displayed on the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/).

You can apply for a Custom Path before your LINE MINI App is reviewed. However, the Custom Path will only be set after the LINE MINI App have passed the review.

In principle, once a Custom Path has been set, it can't be changed.
