## How to upload an image for the icon 

Upload an image for the icon from the **Channel icon** in the **Basic settings** tab of the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/). The only file formats that can be used for an icon are PNG and JPEG.

The uploaded image for the icon is automatically cropped and the icon background is transparent. Make sure that the logo fits into the green square in the preview image.

## Creating from a template file in PSD format (optional) 

We provide a PSD template file that can be used to create an icon. Using the template file, the outline of the icon can be set. Setting the outline will make it easier to recognize the icon when it is placed in front of a background of the same color as the icon in the LINE app. Download the following template file (PSD format) before creating your icon.

### [Recommended] Icon color 

When creating an icon based on the template file, specify the outline color according to the background color. At this point, it is recommended to select a background color type in the template file. Also, hide unused layers in the template file before saving.
