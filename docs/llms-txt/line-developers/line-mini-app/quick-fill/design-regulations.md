# Common Profile Quick-fill design regulations

<!-- tip start -->

**Available only in verified MINI Apps**

To use Common Profile Quick-fill, your LINE MINI App must be verified and you must apply to use Quick-fill. For more information, see [Steps for using Quick-fill](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/quick-fill/overview/#process).

<!-- tip end -->

## User experience with Quick-fill 

In the LINE MINI App Quick-fill, when the end user taps the [Auto-fill button](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/quick-fill/design-regulations/#what-is-auto-fill-button), a modal will appear to confirm the user's profile. After confirming the profile in the displayed modal, the user can tap **Auto-fill** and the profile information will be entered automatically.

You can display the modal by calling the [`liff.$commonProfile.get()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/line-mini-app/#get-common-profile) method. Therefore, there is no need to develop the modal by your company.

The timing of displaying the modal can be set freely according to the configuration of the LINE MINI App, but the following patterns are recommended and prohibited.

- [Recommended screen transitions](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/quick-fill/design-regulations/#recommended-screen-transition)
- [Prohibited screen transitions](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/quick-fill/design-regulations/#prohibited-screen-transition)

### Recommended screen transitions 

When integrating Quick-fill into your LINE MINI App, we recommend the following screen transitions:

- [Display a modal immediately after moving to the member registration screen](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/quick-fill/design-regulations/#show-modal-immediately-after-transition)
- [Display a modal when the user selects an input form](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/quick-fill/design-regulations/#show-modal-when-selecting-input-form)
- [Display a modal after the user taps the Auto-fill button](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/quick-fill/design-regulations/#show-modal-when-tapping-auto-fill-button)
- [Display a modal at the destination after the user agrees on the channel consent screen](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/quick-fill/design-regulations/#show-modal-after-consent-screen)

#### Display a modal immediately after moving to the member registration screen 

When the user moves to the registration screen, display a modal immediately by calling the [`liff.$commonProfile.get()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/line-mini-app/#get-common-profile) method. In this case, place an Auto-fill button on the member registration screen so that the user can display the modal again even if the user close it once.

#### Display a modal at the destination after the user agrees on the channel consent screen 

When the user taps **Allow** on the [channel consent screen](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/develop/configure-console/#consent-screen-settings) of the LINE MINI App, transition the user directly to the registration screen. After transitioning to the registration screen, display a modal immediately by calling the [`liff.$commonProfile.get()`](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/line-mini-app/#get-common-profile) method. In this case, place an Auto-fill button on the member registration screen so that the user can display the modal again even if the user close it once.

### Prohibited screen transitions 

We prohibit the following types of screen transitions when Integrating Quick-fill into the LINE MINI App. If we find an app that performs a prohibited screen transition, we may revoke Quick-fill permission based on the terms of use you agreed to when you applied to use Quick-fill.

- [Display a modal on a screen that doesn't have a form to automatically fill in](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/quick-fill/design-regulations/#show-modal-on-non-auto-fill-form)
- [Getting items that don't exist in the form](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/quick-fill/design-regulations/#get-non-existent-item)
- [Move to the confirmation screen without auto-filling the form](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/quick-fill/design-regulations/#skip-input-form)

#### Display a modal on a screen that doesn't have a form to automatically fill in 

It is prohibited to display a modal on a screen that doesn't have a form that automatically fills in the fields.

![](https://developers.line.biz/media/line-mini-app/quick-fill/prohibited-screen-transition-01.png)

#### Getting items that don't exist in the form 

It is prohibited to get items that don't exist on the form. For example, you must not get phonetic information even though there is no phonetic field on the registration form.

![](https://developers.line.biz/media/line-mini-app/quick-fill/prohibited-screen-transition-02.png)

#### Move to the confirmation screen without auto-filling the form 

It is prohibited to immediately move to the screen without auto-filling the form after the user taps the **Auto-fill** button in the modal. For example, you must not move to the registration confirmation screen without auto-filling the form, or register without displaying the acquired profile information and move to the registration completion screen.
