## Service Messages 

Service messages can be used if you want to send users the confirmation of their restaurant or accommodation reservations.

Service messages is a feature whereby LINE MINI App notifies the user of information the user should know regarding the user's request.

Service messages sent from LINE MINI Apps are displayed in chat rooms determined for each region that provides the LINE MINI App, regardless of the type of LINE MINI App.

To send a service message, use the service message API. For details, see [Sending service messages](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/develop/service-messages/).

<!-- note start -->

**Conditions to sending service messages**

You are allowed to send service messages only as a confirmation or response to a user action on LINE MINI App. Advertisements and event notifications are prohibited, including information on discounts, shopping rewards, new products, discount coupons or promotions. For more information about the service message conditions, see [Conditions for service messages](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/service/service-operation/#conditions-for-service-messages).

<!-- note end -->

## Custom Path 

Custom Path is a unique string that is set in the LIFF URL of the published channel. The Custom Path feature allows you to set your own string in the LIFF URL, as follows:

| Example URL with LIFF ID | Example of setting Custom Path |
| --- | --- |
| `https://miniapp.line.me/123456-abcdefg` | `https://miniapp.line.me/cony_coffee` |

For example, by setting a unique name as a Custom Path, users will be able to identify which brand or shop's LINE MINI App from the URL. For more information on Custom Path, see [Configuring Custom Path](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/develop/custom-path/).

## Skip the channel consent process 

When a user first accesses a LINE MINI App with the `openid` scope enabled, the [channel consent screen](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/develop/configure-console/#consent-screen-settings) is displayed where they need to consent to their [user ID](https://developers.line.biz/en/glossary/#user-id) being used within the LINE MINI App.

To simplify this consent process, turn on the "Channel consent simplification" feature for your LINE MINI App on the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/). This will allow users to skip the channel consent screen when accessing another LINE MINI App and start using the service immediately, simply by consenting to the simplification the first time. As a result, users will be able to access LINE MINI Apps more easily.

For more information, see [Skipping the channel consent process](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/develop/channel-consent-simplification/).

## Add a shortcut to your LINE MINI App to the home screen of the user's device 

The user can add a shortcut to your LINE MINI App to the home screen of the user's device. This allows the user to access your LINE MINI App directly from the home screen of the user's device.

Using this feature for services that users frequently use, such as membership cards and mobile ordering, can improve the user experience.

For more information, see [Add a shortcut to your LINE MINI App to the home screen of the user's device](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/develop/add-to-home-screen/).

## Inducing users to add your Official Account as a friend 

With LINE MINI App, you can induce users to add your Official Account as a friend from the [Channel consent screen](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/develop/configure-console/#consent-screen-settings) or the [Verification screen](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/develop/channel-consent-simplification/#detailed-workflow), using the add friend option.

For more information, see [Add the LINE Official Account as a friend when you first open the LINE MINI App (add friend option)](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/service/line-mini-app-oa/#link-a-line-official-account-with-your-channel).

## Using Payment Systems 

Methods of payment other than LINE Pay, such as credit cards, can be integrated into your LINE MINI App. For more information, see [Using payment systems](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/develop/payment/).

## Custom action button 

The [built-in action button](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/discover/builtin-features/#action-button) is provided to enable users to easily share LINE MINI App among friends, but there is also the option of [implementing a custom action button](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/develop/share-messages/).

## Common Profile Quick-fill 

Quick-fill is a feature that automatically fills in the necessary profile information when you tap **Auto-fill** in LINE MINI Apps. The information from the Common Profile set up in the Account Center can be easily used in LINE MINI Apps. For more information, see [Overview of Common Profile Quick-fill](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/quick-fill/overview/).

![](https://developers.line.biz/media/line-mini-app/quick-fill/quick-fill-3-steps.png)

By implementing Quick-fill in LINE MINI Apps, users can automatically fill in required information such as addresses and phone numbers with a single tap of a button. This eliminates the need for manual input, making it more convenient for users when making reservations at stores or placing orders on online stores.
