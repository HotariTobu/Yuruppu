When the user taps the action button, either the [multi-tab view](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/discover/builtin-features/#multi-tab-view) or the [options](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/discover/builtin-features/#multi-tab-view-option) will be displayed depending on the LINE app version. In LINE version 15.12.0 or later, the multi-tab will be displayed, and in LINE version earlier than 15.12.0, the options will be displayed.

- New features, such as the ability to move back and forth between multiple chat rooms without closing the LINE MINI App, are underway.
- You can't hide the action button on the LINE MINI App. Also, **Module mode** can't be set for LIFF apps added to a LINE MINI App channel.

**Note**

To share the current page, users need to tap the action button on a LINE version that officially supports LINE MINI App. In case of LINE versions lower than the [supported versions](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/discover/specifications/#supported-platforms-and-versions), the action button in the header will always lead to the LINE MINI App's top page, regardless of the individual page being shared.

<!-- note end -->

### Recently used services 

The recently used services section includes LINE MINI Apps and LIFF apps opened by the user, displayed in order of most recent use, up to a maximum of 50 items. The user can use the usage history to reopen the LINE MINI Apps and LIFF apps.

For more information, see [Recently used services](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/overview/#multi-tab-view-recent-service) in the LIFF documentation.

## Channel consent screen 

This Channel consent screen appears when a user uses your LINE MINI App for the first time. The screen prompts the user to grant permissions to your service.

If the LINE MINI App is a verified MINI App, a verified badge will be displayed next to the LINE MINI App name. If the LINE MINI App provider isn't a certified provider, a note saying "LY Corporation hasn't verified this service provider." will be displayed.

**Note**

The Channel consent screen for your LINE MINI App prompts users to grant only the permissions that have been approved by LY Corporation. You can specify the items that require permission from the user in the settings of the LINE MINI App channel on the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/).
