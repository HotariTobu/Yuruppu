# Get started with LINE MINI App

LINE MINI App is a web application that runs on LINE.

By utilizing this platform, developers can provide their services without developing a separate native app.

Likewise, users can use their LINE accounts to enjoy various services that run within LINE without having to download a separate app.

## Process from LINE MINI App development to release
