## Source property in the webhook event of LINE notification messages has been removed 

As announced on [August 9, 2024](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/partner-docs/notice/#partner-news-20240809), as of January 28, 2025, the `source` property in the [Webhook delivery completion event](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/partner-docs/line-notification-messages/message-sending-complete-webhook-event/#receive-delivery-event) of LINE notification messages has been removed.

Until now, when you request the LINE notification messages API and the delivery of a LINE notification message to a user is completed, the following webhook event was sent from the LINE Platform to the bot server:

```json
{
  "destination": "Uc7472b39e21dab71c2347e02714630d6",
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "delivery",
      "delivery": {
        "data": "68df277462529930889fab80ecffdc0883906320591df93c25efc08300410fc2"
      },
      "webhookEventId": "01G17DAF0QJ7A3ERC5EJ9MAMH8",
      "deliveryContext": {
        "isRedelivery": false
      },
      "timestamp": 1650590038721,
      // The following source property has been removed
      "source": {
        "type": "user",
        "userId": "U8189cf6745fc0d808977bdb0b9f22995"
      },
      "mode": "active"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `source` property in the above webhook event has been removed as of January 28, 2025.

We'll continue to work to further improve its service to our customers. Thank you for your understanding.

## Add Quick-fill docs 

Quick-fill is a feature that automatically fills in the necessary profile information by tapping the **Auto-fill** button on the LINE MINI App. You can easily use the Common Profile information that a user has set in the Account Center in the LINE MINI App.

![](https://developers.line.biz/media/line-mini-app/quick-fill/quick-fill-3-steps.png)

By integrating Quick-fill into your LINE MINI App, users can automatically enter an address or phone number with a single tap. For example, when making a reservation at a restaurant or ordering from an online store, users can save themselves the hassle of entering the information manually.

Only certain corporate customers who have been contacted by us can use the Quick-fill feature.

For more information on how to integrate Quick-fill with your LINE MINI App, see [Overview of Quick-fill](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/partner-docs/quick-fill/overview/).

## Notification email is now be sent when webhook redelivery stopped 

In [error notification](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/partner-docs/error-notification/) feature of the Messaging API, a notification email is now sent when webhook redelivery stopped.

If you've [enabled webhook redelivery](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/receiving-messages/#enable-webhook-redelivery) in the Messaging API channel settings, the LINE Platform will redeliver the webhook that your bot server failed to receive. However, if there's no response from your server even after a certain period of time of redelivery, the LINE Platform will stop redelivery.

Previously, when an error has been detected, the LINE Platform sent an error notification email only once. With this change, a notification email will be sent both when the webhook redelivery is started and stopped.

For more information, see [When the LINE Platform stopped webhook redelivery](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/partner-docs/error-notification/#webhook-redelivery-stopped).

## Corrections to the "Get statistics per aggregation unit" document 

In the API reference for "[Get statistics per aggregation unit](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/unit-based-statistics-aggregation/)", there was a mistake in the description of the request body. We've already corrected the mistake but apologize for any inconvenience caused by this error.

See this table for the differences before and after the correction:

- **Assign a unit name to any aggregation unit when sending messages**

 | Items | Incorrect | Correct |
 | --- | --- | --- |
 | Max character limit for `customAggregationUnits` | 100 | 30 |

Note that if you specify a name of aggregation unit that exceeds the maximum characters limit when sending a message, the request won't fail but the unit name won't be assigned to the target message.

## The subject of the email sent upon error notification will be changed 

<!-- note start -->

**Updated on May 25, 2021**

We've updated the [Changes](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/partner-docs/notice/#partner-news-20210428-01) and [Estimated date of change](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/partner-docs/notice/#partner-news-20210428-02).

## We've released a feature for getting statistics per aggregation unit 

You can now obtain statistics per aggregation unit for multiple push messages and multicast messages. You can assign a unit name before sending messages so that you can see statistics for each unit at a later time.

<!-- tip start -->

**When is the feature for getting statistics per aggregation unit useful?**

When sending a narrowcast or broadcast message to multiple users, you can specify a request ID to [get user interaction statistics](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#get-message-event) of that particular message.

![User interaction statistics](https://developers.line.biz/media/news/old_statistics_en.png)

When sending a message to fewer than 20 users, you can't obtain statistics because users' privacy must be protected. However, with the newly-released [Get statistics per aggregation unit](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/unit-based-statistics-aggregation/) feature, even if you send a message to a small number of users, by assigning a unit name before sending the message, you can obtain per-unit statistics on multiple messages.

![Aggregating statistics per unit](https://developers.line.biz/media/news/new_statistics_en.png)

<!-- tip end -->

For more information, see [Get statistics per aggregation unit](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/unit-based-statistics-aggregation/) under the options for corporate customers documentation.
