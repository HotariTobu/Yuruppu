## Overview 

LINE notification messages is a service that allows you to send messages to users by specifying their phone numbers. Even if a user hasn't added your LINE Official Account as a friend, you can send them messages from your LINE Official Account.

LINE notification messages can only be used on LINE Official Accounts in Japan, Thailand and Taiwan.

There are two types of LINE notification messages: [LINE notification messages (template)](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/partner-docs/line-notification-messages/template/), which allow you to easily create messages by combining premade templates and items, and [LINE notification messages (flexible)](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/line-notification-messages/#flexible), which require prior UX review. Each type has different API endpoints.

The following is a sample of a LINE notification message (template):

**The purpose of use for LINE notification messages**

The purpose of use for LINE notification messages is limited to those that we deem useful and appropriate for users. It can't be sent for commercial or advertising purposes.

## Difference in appearance from other messages 

LINE notification messages are displayed with “Important notification” to the right of the LINE Official Account icon to distinguish them from other messages. This function is available in LINE version 15.9.0 or later for iOS, Android, and iPad.
