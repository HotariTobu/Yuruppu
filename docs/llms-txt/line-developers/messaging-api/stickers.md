# LINE Stickers: Catalog Structure and Usage

## How to Send Stickers

The Messaging API allows sending stickers through sticker messages, but only those listed in the official sticker definitions. To send a sticker, you must "specify the package ID and sticker ID of the sticker in a sticker message object."

## ID Format

Stickers use a two-part identification system:
- **Package ID**: A numeric identifier for the sticker collection (examples: 446, 789, 1070, 6136, 8515, 11537)
- **Sticker ID**: A numeric identifier for individual stickers within a package (examples: 1988, 1989, 10551376)

## Catalog Organization

The sticker definitions are organized by package, with each package containing multiple stickers. Packages include titles in multiple languages and display sample sticker previews.

## Restrictions

Users can only send stickers from the official list through the API. Alternative options include:
- Sending personally-owned stickers via LINE Official Account Manager
- Corporate users may access sponsored or creator stickers through special arrangements with sales representatives
