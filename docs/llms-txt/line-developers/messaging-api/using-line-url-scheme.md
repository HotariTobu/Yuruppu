# Use LINE features with the LINE URL scheme

You can open Sticker Shop, LIFF app or camera with the LINE URL scheme. The LINE URL scheme works with LINE Official Accounts too. You can let users see LINE contents from [rich menus](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/using-rich-menus/) with the [action](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#uri-action) to open the LINE URL scheme.

## Supported LINE URL schemes 

The following LINE URL schemes are supported:

| URL scheme | Description |
| --- | --- |
| URL schemes beginning with `https://line.me/R/` | URL scheme for using LINE app features |
| URL schemes beginning with `https://liff.line.me/` | URL scheme for opening the [LIFF app](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/overview/) |
| URL schemes beginning with `https://miniapp.line.me/` | URL scheme for opening the [LINE MINI App](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-mini-app/discover/introduction/) |

<!-- warning start -->

**&quot;line://&quot; is deprecated**

The scheme `line://` is deprecated to prevent takeover attacks that launch a non-LINE app when the URL is clicked, against LY Corporation's or the user's intention. This attack can take place under certain conditions.

No exact date is set for the URL scheme `line://` to become obsolete.

<!-- warning end -->

<!-- note start -->

**LY Corporation doesn't provide a URL scheme for launching native apps other than LINE**

LY Corporation offers no URL scheme to launch native apps other than LINE. However, if a native app from another company has a URL scheme for launching the native app, you can use the URL scheme in the URI action object for [rich menus](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/using-rich-menus/) or [Flex Messages](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/using-flex-messages/).

<!-- note end -->

## What happens when a LINE URL scheme is clicked 

When a user clicks a URL using the LINE URL scheme on a device with LINE installed, LINE is automatically launched showing the content specified by the URL. If LINE isn't installed, what happens differ by the scheme:

| LINE URL scheme | What happens when there is no LINE installed |
| --- | --- |
| `https://line.me/R/` | A web browser is launched and prompts the user to download LINE. |
| `line://` (Deprecated) | Nothing happens or the user is redirected to an error page. |

| LINE URL scheme | Description |
| --- | --- |

<!-- note start -->

**&quot;Percent-encoded LINE ID&quot; must be percent encoded**

Make sure `{Percent-encoded LINE ID}` is [percent encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding) in UTF-8. For example, if the LINE ID is `@linedevelopers` use `https://line.me/R/ti/p/%40linedevelopers` and `https://line.me/R/nv/recommendOA/%40linedevelopers`. If you replaced with the LINE ID that isn't percent encoded, it will also work, but is deprecated.

However, if you percent encode the LINE ID in the URL scheme that opens the "Share with" screen (`https://line.me/R/nv/recommendOA/%40linedevelopers`), it won't work on LINE versions earlier than 13.8.0 for Android.

You can specify either [a Basic ID or a Premium ID](https://help.linebiz.com/lineadshelp/s/article/L000001191?language=ja) (only available in Japanese) as the LINE ID for your LINE Official Account.

<!-- note end -->

<!-- tip start -->

**LINE URL schemes on a PC browser**

When users open `https://line.me/R/ti/p/{Percent-encoded LINE ID}` from a PC, they see the public URL of the LINE Official Account profile (e.g. [LINE FRIENDS profile page](https://line.me/R/ti/p/@linecharacter)) or only a QR code. What users see depends on these conditions:

- Your LINE Official Account is a verified account
- The public URL of the LINE Official Account profile is set to be available

If both conditions are met, users see the public URL of your LINE Official Account, with a QR code. If not, the user sees only the QR code for your LINE Official Account. You can adjust settings on [LINE Official Account Manager](https://manager.line.biz/) to change an unverified account to a verified account, or to use the public URL of your profile.
