# Gain friends of your LINE Official Account

Once you create your LINE Official Account, it's time to promote your LINE Official Account and gain friends. Learn how to expose your LINE Official Account to users:

- [Use QR code](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/sharing-bot/#use-qr-code)
- [Share the LINE ID of your LINE Official Account](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/sharing-bot/#share-the-line-id-of-your-line-official-account)

- [Prompt users to add your LINE Official Account as a friend at LINE Login](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/sharing-bot/#prompt-users-to-add-your-line-official-account-at-line-login)

## Use QR code 

Share the QR code for your LINE Official Account on your website or in a printed format. Users only need to scan your QR code to add your LINE Official Account as a friend. You can get the QR code from the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/) or [LINE Official Account Manager](https://manager.line.biz/).

From the LINE Developers Console, click the **Messaging API** tab of your channel settings.

From the LINE Official Account Manager, click **Home** > **Gain friends** > **"Add friend" tools** > **Create an "Add friend" QR code**. You can copy the HTML snippet and paste the code to your website to display the QR code.

## Share the LINE ID of your LINE Official Account 

Let users know the LINE ID of your LINE Official Account so that the users can search for your LINE Official Account and add your LINE Official Account as a friend on LINE. Find the LINE ID of your LINE Official Account from the header in the [LINE Official Account Manager](https://manager.line.biz/). The text with the at-sign (@) prefix is the LINE ID of your LINE Official Account.

Also, you can purchase a premium ID to create a customized LINE ID that is easier for users to remember. For more information on the premium ID, see [Subscription plan](https://www.lycbiz.com/jp/service/line-official-account/plan/) (only available in Japanese) in LINE for Business.

## Use the Add Friend button or link 

By adding a button or link to your app or website, users can add your LINE Official Account as a friend with a single tap from their device. You can add the following buttons or links:

- [Add Friend button by LINE Social Plugins](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/sharing-bot/#add-friend-button-by-line-social-plugins)
- [Add friend button by LINE Official Account Manager](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/sharing-bot/#add-friend-button-by-the-line-manager)
- [LINE URL scheme for profile page](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/sharing-bot/#line-url-scheme-for-profile-page)

### Add Friend button by LINE Social Plugins 

The LINE Social Plugins generates a piece of code for the [Add Friend button](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-social-plugins/install-guide/using-add-friend-buttons/). All you need to do to add it is copy and paste the code in your app or website. This button is available in multiple languages. You can also display the number of friends that your LINE Official Account has, and add a link to the home page of your LINE Official Account.

To use the **Add Friend** button generated by the LINE Social Plugins, see the instructions on [Create button](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-social-plugins/install-guide/using-add-friend-buttons/#create-button).

### LINE URL scheme for profile page 

From your web app or native app, prompt users to add your LINE Official Account as a friend with this LINE URL scheme. This LINE URL scheme opens the profile page of your LINE Official Account when tapped in LINE for iOS or LINE for Android.

- https://line.me/R/ti/p/`{Percent-encoded LINE ID}`&nbsp;

For example, [`https://line.me/R/ti/p/%40linedevelopers`](https://line.me/R/ti/p/%40linedevelopers) displays the profile page of LINE Developers' LINE Official Account. For more information on the LINE URL scheme, see [Sharing a LINE Official Account](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/using-line-url-scheme/#sharing-line-official-account).

## Encourage users to recommend your LINE Official Account to friends on LINE 

If users have already added your LINE Official Account as a friend, you can encourage the users to recommend your LINE Official Account to their friends on LINE using this LINE URL scheme.

- https://line.me/R/nv/recommendOA/`{LINE ID with @}`&nbsp;

For example, specify this LINE URL scheme in the [URI action object](https://developers.line.biz/en/reference/messaging-api/#uri-action) in a [rich menu](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/using-rich-menus/) or in [template messages](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/message-types/#template-messages).

## Prompt users to add your LINE Official Account as a friend at LINE Login 

If you're using [LINE Login](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-login/overview/) in your web app or native app, you can prompt users to add your LINE Official Account as a friend during login by linking your LINE Official Account to your LINE Login channel. You can choose to include an option in the consent screen or to open a separate "Add LINE Official Account" screen after the user consents.

For instructions on how to link your LINE Official Account to a LINE Login channel, see [Add a LINE Official Account as a friend when logged in (add friend option)](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-login/link-a-bot/).

![If bot_prompt=normal, the option to add a friend is displayed on the consent screen. If bot_prompt=aggressive, the option to add a friend is displayed after the user has consented.](https://developers.line.biz/media/line-login/link-a-bot/bot-prompt-en.png)
