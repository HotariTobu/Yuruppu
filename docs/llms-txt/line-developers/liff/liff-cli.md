# LIFF CLI

<!-- table of contents -->

## What is the LIFF CLI 

LIFF CLI is a CLI tool to help you develop LIFF apps more smoothly.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/line/liff-cli)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@line/liff-cli)

The LIFF CLI allows you to do the following:

- Create, update, list, and delete LIFF apps
- Create a LIFF app development environment
- Debug your LIFF app with the [LIFF Inspector](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/liff-plugin/#liff-inspector)
- Launch a local develpment server with HTTPS

The [LIFF Mock](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/liff-plugin/#liff-mock) feature will be added in a future update.

## Operating environment of the LIFF CLI 

The LIFF CLI runs on Node.js. You can use either npm or Yarn for package management, but the instructions on this page use npm. The content of this page has been tested with each of the following versions:

| Name | Version |
| --- | --- |
| [LIFF CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@line/liff-cli) | 0.4.1 |
| [LIFF SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@line/liff) | 2.24.0 |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) | 22.2.0 |
| [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) | 10.7.0 |

## Install the LIFF CLI 

Open a terminal or command line tool (hereafter referred to as "terminal") and execute the following command:

```bash
$ npm install -g @line/liff-cli
```

The command will install the LIFF CLI and allow you to run the `liff-cli` command.

## Manage channels 

The `channel` command allows you to add a channel to be managed by the LIFF CLI or to set the default channel. Note that channels have to be created beforehand in the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/).

### Add channels 

The `add` subcommand allows you to add a channel to be managed by the LIFF CLI. Pass the channel ID of a channel you want to add to the `add` subcommand and you will be prompted for the channel secret. Enter the channel secret and the channel is added.

```bash
$ liff-cli channel add 1234567890
? Channel Secret?: ********************************
Channel 1234567890 is now added.
```

When passing a channel ID to each LIFF CLI command, the channel with the channel ID has to be added beforehand using the `add` subcommand, as shown above.

### Set the default channel 

The `use` subcommand allows you to set the default channel of the LIFF CLI. Pass the channel ID of a channel you want to set to the `use` subcommand.

```bash
$ liff-cli channel use 1234567890
Channel 1234567890 is now selected.
```

The default channel is used when a channel ID is omitted in each LIFF CLI command.

## Manage LIFF apps 

The `app` command allows you to create, update, list, and delete LIFF apps.

### Create a LIFF app 

The `create` subcommand allows you to create a LIFF app. If the LIFF app is created successfully, the LIFF ID appears in the terminal.

```bash
$ liff-cli app create \
   --channel-id 1234567890 \
   --name "Brown Coffee" \
   --endpoint-url https://example.com \
   --view-type full

## Create a LIFF app template 

The `scaffold` command allows you to create a LIFF app template using [Create LIFF App](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/cli-tool-create-liff-app/). Passing the project name of the LIFF app to the `scaffold` command will execute Create LIFF App using that project name.

```bash
$ liff-cli scaffold my-app --liff-id 1234567890-AbcdEfgh
```

For more information about Create LIFF App, see [Building a LIFF app development environment with Create LIFF App](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/cli-tool-create-liff-app/).

### Options 

The following option is available in the `scaffold` command:

| Option | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-l`, `--liff-id` | | Specify the LIFF ID of a LIFF app. |

## Create a LIFF app development environment 

The `init` command allows you to create a LIFF app development environment. The `init` command performs the following three processes in order:

1. [Add a channel](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/liff-cli/#manage-channels-add)
1. [Create a LIFF app](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/liff-cli/#manage-liff-apps-create)
1. [Create a LIFF app template](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/liff-cli/#scaffold)

```bash
$ liff-cli init \
   --channel-id 1234567890 \
   --name "Brown Coffee" \
   --view-type full \
   --endpoint-url https://example.com
```

For example, the command above adds the channel with a channel ID of "1234567890". Next, the command creates a LIFF app with a LIFF app name of "Brown Coffee", an endpoint URL of "https://example.com", and a view size of "Full" for the channel. Finally, create a template with the LIFF ID of the created LIFF app set.

```bash
liff-cli init \
   --channel-id 1234567890 \
   --name "Brown Coffee" \
   --view-type full \
   --endpoint-url https://example.com

\*1 You need to specify either the option or the prompt if you don't set the [default channel](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/liff-cli/#manage-channels-use).<br>\*2 You need to specify either the option or the prompt.

## Launch a local development server with HTTPS 

The `serve` command allows you to launch a local developement server with HTTPS.

Specifying your local development server, where your LIFF app is running, in the `serve` command launches a local proxy server with HTTPS and rewrites the endpoint URL of your LIFF app with the URL of the local proxy server. This makes it easier for you to launch your local development server with HTTPS.

<!-- note start -->

**Don't execute the serve command for a published LIFF app**

The `serve` command rewrites the endpoint URL of the LIFF app with the URL of the local proxy server, so users can't access the LIFF app. Therefore, don't execute the `serve` command for a published LIFF app.

![](https://developers.line.biz/media/liff/liff-cli/endpoint-url-en.png)

<!-- note end -->

```bash
# If you specify your local development server with the URL
$ liff-cli serve \
   --liff-id 1234567890-AbcdEfgh \
   --url http://localhost:3000/

Successfully updated endpoint url for LIFF ID: 1234567890-AbcdEfgh.

→  LIFF URL:     https://liff.line.me/1234567890-AbcdEfgh
→  Proxy server: https://localhost:9000/
```

```bash
# If you specify your local development server with the host and port number
$ liff-cli serve \
   --liff-id 1234567890-AbcdEfgh \
   --host localhost \
   --port 3000

Successfully updated endpoint url for LIFF ID: 1234567890-AbcdEfgh.

→  LIFF URL:     https://liff.line.me/1234567890-AbcdEfgh
→  Proxy server: https://localhost:9000/
```

### Debug your LIFF app with the LIFF Inspector 

You can debug your LIFF app with the [LIFF Inspector](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/liff-plugin/#liff-inspector) by specifying the `--inspect` option to the `serve` command.

The `--inspect` option launches the LIFF Inspector's LIFF Inspector Server with HTTPS. This allows developers to debug their LIFF apps by simply installing the LIFF Inspector Plugin in their LIFF apps. For more information, see [README](https://github.com/line/liff-inspector/blob/main/README.md) of the LIFF Inspector.

```bash
$ liff-cli serve \
   --liff-id 1234567890-AbcdEfgh \
   --url http://localhost:3000/ \
   --inspect

Successfully updated endpoint url for LIFF ID: 1234567890-AbcdEfgh.

→  LIFF URL:     https://liff.line.me/1234567890-AbcdEfgh
→  Proxy server: https://localhost:9000/?li.origin=wss%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A9222
Debugger listening on wss://192.168.1.6:9222

You need to serve this server over SSL/TLS
For help, see: https://github.com/line/liff-inspector#important-liff-inspector-server-need-to-be-served-over-ssltls
```

When you access the LIFF URL, a URL starting with `devtools://devtools/` appears in the terminal where the `serve` command was executed. If you open this URL with Google Chrome, you can debug the LIFF app on Google Chrome.

```bash
connection from client, id: 1234567890-AbcdEfgh
DevTools URL: devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html?wss=localhost:9222/?hi_id=1234567890-AbcdEfgh
```

### Expose your local development server 

LIFF CLI supports [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) as a proxy. To use ngrok, specify one of the following values for the `--proxy-type` option of the `serve` command:

- [ngrok](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/liff-cli/#serve-proxy-type-ngrok)
- [ngrok-v1](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/liff-cli/#serve-proxy-type-ngrok-v1) (deprecated)

#### Proxy type: `ngrok` 

Specifying `ngrok` for the `--proxy-type` option allows you to use [ngrok](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-javascript) instead of a local proxy server. This allows you to expose your local development server. When using ngrok, set the authtoken of ngrok as the environment variable `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN`.

```bash
$ NGROK_AUTHTOKEN={Authentication token} liff-cli serve \
   --liff-id 1234567890-AbcdEfgh \
   --url http://localhost:3000/ \
   --proxy-type ngrok

Successfully updated endpoint url for LIFF ID: 1234567890-AbcdEfgh.

→  LIFF URL:     https://liff.line.me/1234567890-AbcdEfgh
→  Proxy server: https://1234abcd.ngrok.example.com/
```

#### Proxy type: `ngrok-v1` (deprecated) 

<!-- note start -->

**ngrok-v1 is deprecated**

ngrok v1 is no longer being developed or maintained, so `ngrok-v1` is deprecated. When using ngrok, specify [`ngrok`](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/liff-cli/#serve-proxy-type-ngrok) as the proxy type.

<!-- note end -->

You can use [ngrok v1](https://github.com/inconshreveable/ngrok) instead of a local proxy server by specifying `ngrok-v1` for the `--proxy-type` option. This allows you to expose your local development server. To use this feature, you need to install [ngrok v1](https://github.com/inconshreveable/ngrok) and [node-pty](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-pty).

```bash
$ liff-cli serve \
  --liff-id 1234567890-AbcdEfgh \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:3000/ \
  --proxy-type ngrok-v1

ngrok-v1 is experimental feature.

→  Proxy server: https://1234abcd.ngrok.example.com/
```

### Operating conditions of the `serve` command 

For the `serve` command to work, all of the following conditions must be met:

- Create a valid certificate (`localhost.pem`) and private key (`localhost-key.pem`) for localhost
- Execute the `serve` command at the location where you created `localhost.pem` and `localhost-key.pem` (e.g. root directory of the LIFF app project)

Follow these steps to create a valid certificate (`localhost.pem`) and private key (`localhost-key.pem`) for localhost. Use [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) here. For more information about mkcert, see [README](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/blob/master/README.md) of mkcert.

1. Execute the following command to install `mkcert`:

```bash
# For macOS (using Homebrew)
$ brew install mkcert

# For Windows (using Chocolatey)
$ choco install mkcert
```

2. Execute `mkcert -install` to create a local certificate authority.

```bash
$ mkcert -install
```

3. Execute `mkcert localhost` to create a valid certificate (`localhost.pem`) and private key (`localhost-key.pem`) for localhost.

```bash
$ mkcert localhost
Note: the local CA is not installed in the Firefox trust store.
Run "mkcert -install" for certificates to be trusted automatically ⚠️

Created a new certificate valid for the following names 📜
 - "localhost"

The certificate is at "./localhost.pem" and the key at "./localhost-key.pem" ✅
```
