# Adding a LIFF app to your channel

When you add a LIFF app to a LINE Login channel on the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz/console/), the LIFF app can run either in LINE or in an external browser.

<!-- tip start -->

**We recommend creating a LIFF app as a LINE MINI App**

In the future, LIFF and the LINE MINI App will be integrated into a single brand. As a result of this integration, LIFF will be integrated into the LINE MINI App. For this reason, we recommend that you create a new LIFF app as a LINE MINI App. For more information, see the news from [February 12, 2025](https://developers.line.biz/en/news/2025/02/12/line-mini-app/).
