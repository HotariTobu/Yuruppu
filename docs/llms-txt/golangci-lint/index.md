# golangci-lint

> golangci-lint is a fast linters aggregator for Go that runs 100+ linters in parallel, reuses Go build cache, and caches analysis results. It consolidates multiple linting tools into a single unified system with YAML configuration, IDE integration, and minimal false positives.

golangci-lint is designed to streamline Go code quality processes by providing a single tool that runs multiple linters efficiently. It supports flexible output formats (JSON, HTML, SARIF, etc.), integrates with major IDEs and CI systems, and uses simple YAML configuration files.
