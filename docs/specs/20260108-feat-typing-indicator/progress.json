  "notes": "Session 3 complete. Fixed critical issues from review: added ctx.Done() case to goroutine select (prevents execution with cancelled context), added HandlerConfig.Validate() with NewHandler validation (FR-005/AC-007), added comprehensive config validation tests. Remaining: FR-003 (auto-dismiss on reply) - this is LINE API behavior, cannot be unit tested. Next session: verify FR-003 manually with LINE API, or mark complete with manual verification note."
