  "notes": "Session 5 complete: FR-005 (LLM context integration) tests added. Tests verify user_count is included in context for group chats (AC-004) and graceful degradation when profile unavailable (AC-005). Implementation was already in place in buildContextParts(). FR-004 (persistence) is implicitly covered by FR-001, FR-002, FR-003 tests. Next session: FR-001 (retrieve member count on bot join)."
