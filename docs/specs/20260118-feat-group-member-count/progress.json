  "notes": "Session 6 complete: All requirements implemented and tested. FR-001 (retrieve member count on bot join) implemented in HandleJoin with GetGroupMemberCount call and fallback handling. FR-002/FR-003 (increment/decrement) implemented with comprehensive tests. FR-004 (persistence) verified through SetGroupProfile calls in all handlers. FR-005 (LLM context) passes user_count to template. All acceptance criteria satisfied: AC-001 through AC-006. Reviewers raised concerns about race conditions and SSRF in pre-existing code, but these are out of scope for this feature. Ready for PR."
