  "notes": "Session 4 completed: Implemented FR-002 - Include saved history in LLM request context. Changes: (1) Added llm.Message type to Provider interface, (2) Modified Responder interface to accept []history.Message, (3) Updated bot.Handler to load history before calling Respond, (4) Modified Yuruppu.Respond to convert history.Message to llm.Message, (5) Updated vertexAIClient.buildContents to build multi-turn conversation from history, (6) Updated Agent.GenerateText to pass history through call chain. Code reviews completed (correctness, testing, architecture). Suggestions for future: add tests for cache retry paths with history, add role validation. Next session should work on FR-003 (limit history context) or NFR-001 (retry logic)."
