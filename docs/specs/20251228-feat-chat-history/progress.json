  "notes": "Session 3: Integrated GCSStorage into bot.Handler. Changes: (1) Added history.Storage dependency to bot.Handler, (2) Save user message and bot response after successful LLM response, (3) Storage errors prevent sending reply per NFR-002, (4) Added HISTORY_BUCKET env var to main.go, (5) Added GCS client lifecycle management. FR-001 verified - messages saved to history with tests. NFR-002 verified - storage errors prevent response with tests. Code reviews completed: correctness, testing, architecture, security. Suggestions noted: add sourceID validation, use UTC timestamps, add context cancellation check. Next session should start with FR-002 (include history in LLM context) - requires modifying Responder interface or yuruppu agent to accept history."
