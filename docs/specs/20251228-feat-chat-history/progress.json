  "notes": "Session 1: Implemented storage types and interface foundation (Message, ConversationHistory, Storage interface, error types). All tests pass. Next session should implement GCS storage backend with: 1) JSONL file operations, 2) Read-modify-write pattern with preconditions, 3) Context timeout handling. Consider code review suggestions: JSON tag casing (PascalCase to camelCase), add Role type constants, enhance error types with structured fields."
