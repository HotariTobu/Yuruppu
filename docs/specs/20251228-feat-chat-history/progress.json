  "notes": "Session 2: Implemented GCSStorage backend with full test coverage (14 test cases). Features: JSONL read/write, read-modify-write with generation preconditions, context timeout handling, proper error wrapping. Code review findings: (1) TOCTOU race is documented GCS limitation, (2) consider adding sourceID validation, (3) extract JSONL parsing to reduce duplication, (4) add logging for production debugging. All issues are suggestions for future improvement. Preflight passes. Next session: Integrate Storage into message handling flow - connect GCSStorage to bot/agent to save/retrieve conversation history during message processing."
