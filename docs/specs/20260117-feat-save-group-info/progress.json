  "notes": "Session 1: Fixed broken test imports from prototype phase. Renamed userprofile/profile_test.go to userprofile_test.go. Created join_test.go for HandleJoin tests. AC-002 interpretation: HandleJoin returns error, caller handles gracefully (not HandleJoin swallowing errors). Session 2: All reviewers passed. Webhook server dispatch for JoinEvent is out of scope (handled by cli-group-chat spec). groupprofile_test.go not added but HandleJoin tests cover service integration. Consider adding unit tests for groupprofile.Service in future."
