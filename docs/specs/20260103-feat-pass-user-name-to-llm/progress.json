  "notes": "Session 1 complete: FR-001-004 and NFR-001 implemented. Profile service with cache and persistence working. HandleFollow fetches profiles. buildContextParts includes profile in LLM request. FR-005 (group/room chat support) pending - design allows cached profiles but active fetch only on Follow. Next session: Add PROFILE_BUCKET to Terraform, add profileStorage.Close to shutdown, then implement FR-005 if needed."
