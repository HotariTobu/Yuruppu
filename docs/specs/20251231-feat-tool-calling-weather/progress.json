  "notes": "Implementation complete but test coverage incomplete. Next session should: (1) Add tool calling integration test for AC-001 to verify weather query flow, (2) Restore unit tests or verify integration tests cover critical paths. Deleted gemini_test.go - lifecycle tests moved to integration. Reviewer findings: URL encoding in weather.go location parameter should be added."
