  "notes": "Session 2 complete: Integrated GroupSimService into cmd/cli/main.go for -group-id flag handling (FR-001 to FR-005). Added handleGroupMode() function to reduce cyclomatic complexity. Tests verify: (1) flag parsing works, (2) new groups are created with first member, (3) existing members can join, (4) non-members are rejected with proper error message, (5) 1-on-1 mode unchanged without -group-id. FR-013 (persistence) passes since GroupSimService uses storage. NFR-002 (existing behavior unchanged) passes. Reviewer findings: (1) Security: add groupID validation to prevent path traversal, (2) Architecture: handleGroupMode creates its own storage instead of receiving it as dependency - consider refactoring, (3) Correctness: double 'groupsim/' prefix bug exists (storage prefix + groupKey function). These are noted for future sessions but not blocking. All preflight checks pass. Next session should focus on FR-006/FR-007 (group chat context and REPL prompt changes) - requires updating repl.Config to accept GroupID and setting chat type appropriately."
